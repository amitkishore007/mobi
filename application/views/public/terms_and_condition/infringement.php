							<p>Mobicharge is committed to removing infringing products from the site. To facilitate this, Mobicharge has put in place a Mobicharge Infringement Verification process so that intellectual property owners could easily report listings that infringe their rights. It is in Mobicharge's interest to ensure that infringing products are removed from the site, as they erode Buyer and Seller trust.
